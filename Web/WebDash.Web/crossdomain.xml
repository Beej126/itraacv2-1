<!--
. To support test/dev web client (e.g. Silverlight) on local web server (e.g. ASP.Net Dev Server) calling to production web server for WCF/SOAP/web service, need to allow crossdomain access.

. crossdomain.xml is the adobe flash standard that microsoft also supports in addition to a new microsoft specific file (clientaccesspolicy.xml)
  . http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc645032%28v=vs.95%29.aspx
  . i've read that the microsoft specific one is sometimes not working and the crossdomain.xml is often the recommended solution, so i just went with that
  
. this file must be placed in the web server's root folder
